Knockout and AngularJS have popularized the concept of declarative data binding in UI views. [Reactive](https://github.com/component/reactive) is a library that gives you this convinience in Ã  la carte fashion.

*Note: reactive does 1-way data binding: from the model to the view - it does not support 2-way binding. It can be made to approach 2-way binding behavior by declaring custom bindings.*

## Basic Example

Suppose you have an object `Person`, and it is an [event emitter](/object/events/event-emitter).

``` js
var EventEmitter = require('emitter');
function Person(name, age){
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
Person.prototype = new EventEmitter;
var bob = new Person('Bob', 35);
```

You have the following view, which displays information about a person:

``` html
<div id="person-view">
  <label>Name:</label>
  <span>{ name }</span>
  <label>Age:</label>
  <span>{ age }</span>
</div>
```

To wire up the view to the model, do this:

``` js
var elm = document.getElementById('person-view');
reactive(elm, bob);
```

Alternatively, the first argument can be a string containing the markup.

``` js
reactive('<div id="person-view">...</div>', bob);
```

Once the wiring is done, whenever the model notifies the view of property changes, the view will update. By default, reactive expects the property change events to be of the form `change <property name>`. So, for example, if I change Bob's age

``` js
bob.age = 36;
```

I would need to trigger the change event to notify the view

``` js
bob.emit('change age');
```

which causes the view to re-render its age display.

## Models

Now I know what you are saying: *why trigger the event manually? Backbone models will do that for you!* Valid point. Reactive is actually pluggable and can be made to work with a variety of model implementations, including Backbone models. To do this, we need an adapter for backbone models. A model adapter is a constructor that takes a model object and implements the following methods:

* subscribe
* unsubscribe
* unsubscribeAll
* set
* get

See the [adapters documentation](https://github.com/component/reactive#adapters) for more details on how to implement your own adapter. I've made it easy for you, here's the code for the Backbone adapter:

``` js
function BackboneAdapter(model){
  if (!(this instanceof BackboneAdapter)){
    return new BackboneAdapter(model);
  }
  this.model = model;
}

BackboneAdapter.prototype = {
  subscribe: function(prop, fn){
    // This tells it how to bind a property change event
    this.model.on('change:' + prop, fn);
  },
  unsubscribe: function(prop, fn){
    // This tells it how to unbind a property change event
    this.model.off('change:' + prop, fn);
  },
  unsubscribeAll: function(){
    // This tells it how to unbind all events
    this.model.off();
  },
  set: function(prop, value){
    // This tells it how to set a property on a model
    this.model.set(prop, value);
  },
  get: function(prop, value){
    // This tells it how to get a property on a model
    return this.model.get(prop);
  }
}
```

Now, to test it out, first make a backbone model instance:

``` js
var bob = new Backbone.Model({name: 'Bob', age: 35});
```

Bind the backbone model to the view using reactive, supplying the backbone adapter

``` js
reactive(elm, bob, {adapter: BackboneAdapter});
```

And voila! Now the view will automatically update when the model's attributes are set - such as `bob.set('name', 'Robert')`. 

Everyone loves Backbone, right? If Backbone is not your thing though, that's okay too! For alternative model implementations, have a look at [Bamboo](https://github.com/defunctzombie/bamboo) and [Modella](https://github.com/modella/modella).

## String Interpolation

Now you are ready to take a closer look at Reactive's the string interpolation feature. Take this example:

``` html
<article>
  <h2>{ name }</h2>
</article>
```

Reactive interpolates expressions between `{` and `}`. The syntax can be simple properties, but can also be more complex JavaScript expressions, such as method calls:

```
{ name.toUpperCase() }
```

and string concatenation:

```
{ firstName + ' ' + lastName }
```

The properties used in these expressions will be bound automatically so that if they change, the view updates correctly.

## Declarative Bindings

In addition to string interpolation, Reactive also provides declarative bindings - which are written as attributes of DOM elements. I'll walk through the important ones.

### `data-text` Binding

Binds a model property to the text content of the element.

``` html
<p>First name: <span data-text="first"></span></p>
```

### `data-html` Binding

`data-html` binds a model property to the inner HTML of the element.

``` html
<article id="content" data-html="content"></article>
```

### `data-<attr>` Binding

`data-<attr>` binds a model property to an attribute of the element. 

``` html
<a data-href="download_url">Download</a>
```

### `data-visible` and `data-hidden` Bindings

`data-visible` binds a boolean model property. If the value is true, it adds the class `visible` to the element, otherwise, it addes the class `hidden` to the element. This allows for conviniently showing or hiding it - note that you'll need to write CSS rules to instruct the browser how you want to show or hide the element based on these classes (you could use CSS animations or simply display: none). `data-hidden` does the opposite of `data-visible`.

``` html
<p data-hidden="hasItems">no items</p>
<ul data-visible="hasItems">
  <li each="items">{name}</li>
</ul>
```

### `data-checked` Binding

`data-checked` binds a model property to the `checked` property of a checkbox.

``` html
<input type="checkbox" data-checked="agreed_to_terms">
```

### `each` Binding

`each` gives you the ability to iterate an array of objects. It binds a model property - the value of which should be an array - and renders the original contents of the element once for each item in the array. Example:

``` js
<ul each="children">
  <li>{last}, {first}</li>
</ul>
```

*Note: in order to be notified of changes in the array, the `each` binding [duck punches](http://www.paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/) the instance of array that's in use.*

If you use Backbone, you might be wondering whether this can iterate a `Backbone.Collection`. Currently the answer is no.

### Event Bindings

You can use an event binding to delegate event handling to your code. To specify a handler for a `click` event on an element, you'd use the `on-click` binding:

``` html
<button on-click="save">Save</button>
```

The value specified - in this case: `save` - maps to a method in the delegate object, which you'll need to specify as an option to reactive. For example:

``` js
var delegate = {
  save: function(e, view){
    var model = view.model;
    request.post('/api/person/', model.serialize());
  }
}

reactive(elm, bob, {
  delegate: delegate
});
```

All the common DOM events are supported.

### More On Bindings

[Read the docs](https://github.com/component/reactive#declarative-bindings) for refenences on all the bindings. It is also possible to write your own [custom bindings](https://github.com/component/reactive#writing-bindings) that do amazing things! I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.

## A View Pattern

There is a view pattern that works well for applications that use Reactive. It looks like this

``` js
function UserView(user){
  this.user = user;
  this.view = reactive(html, user, {
    delegate: this // event delegate is set to the instance itself
  });
}

// Event handlers via event binding can simply be written as methods
UserView.prototype.edit = function(evt){
  ...
}
```
